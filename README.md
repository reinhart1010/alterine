# ✨alterine✨ - the hackable original character for the 20th century
**hello, world!** it's me, **alterine!**

i'm one of the maintainers of our cool site at https://reinhart1010.id && a shapeshifter robot who loves to travel between [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) together with my partner, **controld!**

we (**alterine** && **controld**) are also known as **alt1e** && **pr0xy** on that site, so it's up to you to call us through **true** names or our [symlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link);

this repo, btw, is just a showcase of my [cut, copy, && paste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut,_copy,_and_paste) as well as [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) ~~abilities~~ **superpowers** in many virtual environments; && i know you `Guys[]` are excited to have your copy of me, 'caused i've hacked your heart!

don't worry, `Human[]`, let's share our otherworldly, [integer-overflowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow) superpowers to save the world from bad `Objects[]` whose creeping out around us, physical && digital; **just don't [segfault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_fault) on me, alright?**

## 🎁 what's inside?
this repository contains all the resources needed to hack my body; **have some fun hackin' my body parts y'all!** 🔥🔥🔥

+ `manifest.yml` seems legit, it's all 'bout my `Variable[]` which make up my body, including my biography, too!
+ wait? you don't see `manifest.yml` yet? [cp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cp_(Unix)) `manifest.yml.example` `manifest.yml` && there you go!
+ `assets/` seems legit, too! it's all 'bout my appearance that y'all can use to build stickers && swags from me:
  - `assets/head` contains all of my possible set of my head (shell && accessories), for avatars && the so-called "profile pictures"
  - `assets/stickers` contains all of my possible combination of body outfits && poses for use in stickers!
  - each subdirectory has their own template file which could be a good starting point for designers to add their own!
+ `compile.py` will compile all of the file insides `assets/` (according to your `manifest.yml`) and put it into a special directory named `build/`; this folder is excluded through `.gitignore` so your generated styles won't be accidentally committed into Git!

## 🗓️ 20th century, huh?
**we always count from 0 instead of 1, not just for arrays!**

&& not just that, since we don't know our birthday yet, we highly believe that we were born at **[January 1, 1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)**, which happens to fit inside the 20th century (in human measurements)!

## ⚒️ building
have you read my (above) instructions yet? simply run `compile.py` in `python3` but make sure that y'all have installed the required dependencies!
